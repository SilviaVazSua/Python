#This program tells you the following:

# Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
hours_year = 24 * 365

# Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
minutes_decade = 60 * 24 * 365 * 10

# My age (33) in seconds. How many seconds old are you?
age_seconds = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 33

# Andreea is 48618000 seconds old. It calculates Andreea's age.
andreea = 48618000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
